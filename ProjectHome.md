<h3>Introduction</h3>

The goal of the project RMaxima is to create a package that allows to use from within R the capabilities of Maxima, a Computer Algebra System much more powerful than the symbolic algebra systems available for R right now. The package should add new functionality to R for using symbolic expressions, such as equation solving, differentiation, integration, three-dimensional plotting, or multiple-precision arithmetics.<br>
